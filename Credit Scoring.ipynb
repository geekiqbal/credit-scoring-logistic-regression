    "After you compute the cost function. You will create an \"`optimizer`\" object. You have to call this object along with the cost when running the tf.session. When called, it will perform an optimization on the given cost with the chosen method and learning rate.\n",

    "For instance, for gradient descent the optimizer would be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate = learning_rate).minimize(cost)\n",

    "\n",
    "This computes the backpropagation by passing through the tensorflow graph in the reverse order. From cost to inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** When coding, we often use `_` as a \"throwaway\" variable to store values that we won't need to use later. Here, `_` takes on the evaluated value of `optimizer`, which we don't need (and `c` takes the value of the `cost` variable). "
